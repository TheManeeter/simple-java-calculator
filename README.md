# Simple Java Calculator
A simple console calculator coded in Java.

This is a fairly simple and efficient calculator that can multiply, divide, add, and subtract.

**Note: You must run the "run.bat" file, not the .jar file.**

Also, the .bat file must be in the same folder as the .jar file or the file will not run.
You also must have JDK 17 installed on your machine.
